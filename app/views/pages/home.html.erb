    <h4 class="title is-4 mt-3">
      INNOSERV is a project developing an EU wide research agenda to evaluate innovation in the field of social

        INNOSERV responds to the FP7-Cooperation call FP7-SSH-2011-3 for a ‘support action concerning a social platform on innovative social services.’
        <br>
        Answering the objectives of the call, the INNOSERV project will:
        <ul class="is-size-5 mb-3">
          <li>Produce short visual examples combined with theoretical case studies of ‘innovative’ practices in the fields of health, education and welfare. These will be used to help inform discussion and debate;</li>
          <li>Develop a web based ‘social platform’ for continuing dialogue;</li>
          <li>Manage a multi-level discussion involving a wide range of stakeholders from research, policy making and practice communities in the EU to identify priorities for future research and development.</li>
        </ul>
        Publications will summarise the results of the debate and formulate future research needs.
