1
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,720
In many countries in Europe, the demand for care workers is growing. 

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,040
This demand is often met by cross border workers. 

3
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,000
Organisations in 16 Member States have agreed on a set of 

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,520
Basic Social Care Learning Outcomes (BESCLO) 

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,480
for entry -level carers working in the EU. 

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,560
BESCLO can be taught through work-based training,  

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,720
a single short course or at distance. 

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,360
Carers demonstrating a knowledge of BESCLO are awarded the 

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,560
European Care Certificate (ECC). 

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,520
2-day ECC compliant training in Katymar, Hungary. 

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:24,040
I have been thinking about becoming a carer for years. 

12
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,400
I've been working as a cleaning lady in a hospital 

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,280
for almost 12 years 

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,400
I've learned a lot about care from the nurses 

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,840
as we work alongside each other every day

16
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:49,920
I would like to go abroad and help the patients there. 

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,040
In Katymar, many course participants who pass the ECC exam, 

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,120
use the certificate to find care work abroad.

19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,440
With the growth of the care sector, and increasing worker mobility,

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,360
the ECC responds to a need for qualifications to be harmonised across the EU. 

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,120
The ECC is available in 16 countries 

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,080
The BESCLO cover: 

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,280
Values of social care. 

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,640
Promoting life quality for those you support. 

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,640
Working with risk 

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Understanding your role as care worker

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,920
Safety at work. 

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,080
Communicating positively. 

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,560
Recognising and responding to abuse or neglect. 

30
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,160
Developing as a worker. 

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Unfortunately my mother got cancer 

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,520
and I had to take care of her. 

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,000
Sadly, this 'school' 

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,840
gave me a lot of experience. 

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,600
And after my poor mother died, 

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,520
the opportunity arose to go to Germany 

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,520
to look after older people. 

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,440
You can pick up the practical things 

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,280
like changing incontinence pads 

40
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,320
or giving injections 

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,640
but I am taking this course because 

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,840
I want to know how to deal with the psychological side of this job. 

43
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,280
And when I heard that for a reasonable price I could 

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,440
take a course like this preparing me for the job, 

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,480 
I didn't hesitate. 

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,400
For many, the ECC is about 'upgrading' valuable skills aquired through 

47
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,760
informal care work, looking after a family member for example. 

48
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,840
With time, the ECC will be recognised by employers across Europe. 

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,960
And all European care staff working at entry level will have the same 

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,560
knowledge of the values and attitudes expected of them. 

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,560
A common definition of basic knowledge for entry level care staff. 

52
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,720
More transparency for employers and carers about necessary skills. 

53
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,760
Facilitating cross border mobility.
