00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
The Somerset Pain Management Service is using a digital health system

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,880
to enable patients to manage their long term pain.

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,120
The system has beed developed by 'Know Your Own Health'

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,720
or 'KYOH' for short.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,160
KYOH is an online system of self-management support:

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,920
- information on the health condition

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,160
- personalised self-management support

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,480
-telephone mentors and on-line peer support

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
Hi to all and anyone out there.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,480
I've been managing back pain since April 22nd 2011.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,800
I've gone from being totally immobilised with severe pain 

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,800
to being able to go to the gym, walk a good distance, 

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,720
do most household chores. 

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,480
do most household chores. 

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,720
though I find hoovering painful and let my girlfriend mow the lawn!

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,480
I get a lot out of talking to people in similar states 

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,960
so welcome the communication.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,000
I value a positive mental attitude

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,560
which is reflected in taking positive action.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,760
I hate dependence on medication or the doctor.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,800
In England, there are more than 15 million people living with

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,480
a long term condition

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,880
and a good percentage of those people are living with 

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,280
 multiple long term conditions.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,920
Those people only work with health services

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,800
on average for between 3 and 7 hours a year.

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:33,840
What we decided to do was to become  

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,440
What we decided to do was to become  

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,880
a service that saw people and worked with them to support them

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,800
to manage their pain in between appointments with us.

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,920
When the pain management clinic meetings had finished,

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
if there had been nothing left,

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,120
"that's it, off you go then..."

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,760
"yeah, you're going to have pain for the rest of your life"

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,840
"we haven't got the resources to deal with you!"

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,440
That would have been very threatening actually.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,960
Know Your Own Health is really about

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,840
bringing together all of the things that can support you

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
putting you in control

40
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
and enabling you to have sensible, shared

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,800
decision-making processes with your healthcare professional.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,320
The first thing I was interested in when I first logged on

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,560
was the trackers and the goals. 

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,000
Although I had a whole raft of self help techniques

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,880
they were a bit unstructured.

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,560
The trackers I've got are my mood, activities and pain.

47
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,160
so with the activities section, you've got ordinary everyday activities

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,720
moving up to intense exercise.

49
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,000
that was very useful for me 

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,760
to keep a record of the sort of exercise I was doing

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,280
and how that related to the pain.

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,560
Initially I was monitoring them just to see what 

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,200
the correlation between my moods and activity etc was

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,040
in relation to the pain

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,840
but it became really clear very quickly

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,920
that mood was playing a massive part in it.

57
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,680
You can add trackers of course.

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,080
You could put in your diet.

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,480
Or how much alcohol I'm drinking. 

60
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,840
How much is that going to affect my pain?

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,800
There have been days where I've let it slide,

62
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,040
if someone in the community is logging on and registering that, 

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,160
I might get a little, "Hey, where are you?" 

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
"You haven't been doing this for a couple of days!"

65
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
and it's like, "...yeah...I know..."

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,960
When you're living with pain, or any long term condition, 

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,760
the one word that describes it most for me is 'lonely'.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,120
You feel completely isolated from your family, your colleagues...

69
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,440
Everybody. Nobody really understands what it's like

70
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,760
to live with constant pain unless you're in that situation.

71
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,040
I certainly felt despair, and hopeless...

72
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,320
I would feel very awkward about complaining about pain.

73
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,480
"I'm a man! I don't do that sort of thing; I don't talk about it!"

74
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,120
But the great thing about KYOH is the community.

75
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,680
Both in terms of communicating with each other 

76
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,840
and offering practical tips

77
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,720
but just that, 

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,160
"Yeah, I understand. I know exactly what you're going through mate."

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,680
That's worth it's weight in gold.

80
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,480
I'm sure I could benefit from the support of others

81
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,960
and I guess that most of us could.

82
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,840
Does anyone know any support groups for pain management in Frome?

83
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Those people who have worked with us, who have used KYOH

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,800
are becoming experts in their own right

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,880
and many of them want to contribute and support other people

86
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
who maybe don't even need to see us.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but through working with those people who've worked with us, 

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,840
and through working with them, through KYOH,

89
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,160
we can start to build that community capability and capacity

90
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,480
to manage pain.

91
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,880
I'm very keen actually,

92
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,480
to be able to pass on what I've learned

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,200
and help to educate other people.

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,240
I can see that there will be less dependence on doctors

95
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,000
and more self-reliance, and more reliance on the community

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,800
which has got to be a good thing.

97
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,160
INNOVATIVE ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT:

98
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,300
Use of digital technology for the care 

99
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,700
of people with a long term health condition;

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,320
Patients self manage their health condition;

101
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,500
Integration of the health service

102
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,800
with an independent digital service provider.
