1
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,960
The Real Pearl Foundation provides art education

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,480
to around 600 Roma and non-Roma children

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,080
in 12 settlements in Eastern Hungary.

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,040
Classes are provided in local schools

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,200
and in a purpose-built art school and community centre.

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,400
Working in partnership with the children's families,

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,200
the Foundation organises income-generating activities

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,000
and has set up a project to tackle fuel poverty.

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,960
While working with these children,

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,040
we had to acknowledge several basic facts.

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,800
One of the most significant was that 

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,960
the problems of children with multiple disadvantages

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,360
would never be solved within the schools.

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,520
I think that creativity is an unbelievable thing.

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,560
It is crucial for children who face failures in primary school

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,800
at home and in every segment of society

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,840
to experience success somewhere.

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,160
It gives them self-confidence, pride and vision in the future.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:52,600
The success of the school is a testament to the success of the method.

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,760
Our pupils win 500 prizes a year all over the world.

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,120
After we had seen how successful 

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,560
creative activities could be for children, 

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,120
and how easily it worked with personal development, 

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,720
it was clear that we should try the same with parents too.

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,800
Nora had the idea to copy drawings made by

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
children attending Real Pearl art school

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,360
onto canvas.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,760
They bring us the children’s drawings, 

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,400
we draw them on the canvas

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,760
and then give them to the women who embroider them.

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,000
When they are ready they bring them back to us

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:00,000
and we put them on cell phone cases, cushions and bags.

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,240
We receive money for the products we have made.

34
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,040
These products can be bought 

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,160
at the Real Pearl Foundation’s social webshop.

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,760
We carry out complex work in which self-preservation 

37
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,560
and the motivation to work

38
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,840
are the two most important principles.

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,600
We buy medicines, distribute food donations, 

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,680
make bio-briquettes for heating in the winter.

41
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,320
We row them on these strings with an iron nail.

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,880
And we put these small sticks between them,

43
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,600
so that air can circulate and it dries faster.

44
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,160
It is packed and we distribute it

45
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
among Roma and Hungarian people

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,920
who don’t have firewood.

47
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
The Foundation actually

48
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,480
fills the gaps left by 'this' badly working system, 

49
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,480
it does a bit of social work,

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,920
helps the healthcare system a bit, 

51
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,600
gets a bit involved in the work of the authorities, in education…

52
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,720
but we don’t want to keep it this way. 

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,200
This system does not work well this way. 

54
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,920
We would like to become part of the state system.

55
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,880
INNOVATIVE ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT:

56
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,920
Child-centered art education for disadavantaged children,

57
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,000
fostering cognitive skills and personality development;

58
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,680
Artistic activities for children are linked to social work, 

59
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,480
community building and income generating activities

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,160
with parents (embroidery work sold through social webshop);

61
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,560
Filling the gap left by the state in providing complex solutions

62
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,040
in the most deprived and segregated rural settlements.
