1
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,040
The Trialogue breaks with professional paternalism

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,400
and the dominance of medical expertise by recognising the expertise

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,280
of users of psychiatric services.

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,000
The approach started in the 1980s in the "psychosis seminars" in Hamburg.

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,000
For a long time many thought that you could fight prejudice

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,320
by stressing that it was an organic illness.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,680
Today we know empirically that this argument has the opposite effect:

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,680
it increases stigma.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,040
What works are personal encounters

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,640
and the message that psychiatric illness is something human.

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,880
I was diagnosed as schizophrenic

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,840
and noone ever involved me in my treatment.

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,200
I spent 9 months in an asylum and not a single discussion took place.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,600
The vision of the Trialogue

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,400
relatives:

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,960
For me the Trialogue is about having the opportunity

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,000
to change an unbearable situation.

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,040
(ex-)users of psychiatry:

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,160
It's about exchanging experiences.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,000
Even as a person with crisis experience,

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,960
you are often unaware of the experience of your relatives,

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,840
not least because you were always told that it shouldn't be discussed. 

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,480
The Trialogue broke right through this.

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,520
professionals:

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,200
For me the Trialogue is an encounter on an equal footing

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,480
building respect for each other as experts

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,840
finding a common language

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,520
taking the diversity of situations linked to psychosis seriously

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,360
which also demand diverse forms of support.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,440
encounter on equal footing - 
changing attitudes

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,280
respect - participation - awareness raising

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,000
How it all started: The Psychosis Seminars

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,880
It was a seminar for students

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,400
and professionals

35
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,120
where you suddenly appeared.

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,480
And it was about how therapists deal with the topics of psychoses

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,280
how seriously they take them

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
and you said "I want to be interviewed, too"

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,720
and that impressed so many people

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,560
that we decided together

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,120
that many more people like Dorothea Buck should be present.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,080
And then my thought was to include the relatives, too,

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,720
which happened in the 'next term' 

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,320
when there were 70-80 people,

45
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,280
with equal numbers of users of psychiatric services,

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,800
relatives and professionals exchanging views.

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,040
Awareness raising in wider society: Irre Menschlich Hamburg

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,800
At some point the need emerged to

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
also fight public prejudice together 

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,400
which led to the creation of Irre Menschlich Hamburg.

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,360
This initiative developed rapidly over 10 years

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,680
e.g. more than 1000 school projects, work with religious communities

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,080
training for health care professionals, training for the police.

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,320
In 2008 and 2009 the Hamburg police had

55
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,360
an increasing number of situations involving psychologically ill people

56
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,920
during which police officers

57
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,120
used firearms, with fatal consequences, three times.

58
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,400
We then started an initative with Prof. Bock.

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,760
What was special about this event was

60
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,840
that for the first time people with psychiatric illness

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,600
had a discussion with the police

62
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,760
about how they feel

63
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,000
when uniformed police threaten to use coercive means. 

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,040
We learned a lot from this.

65
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,240
For us it is now about

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,960
understanding these people, and respecting them.

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Experienced Involvement (EX-IN):

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,600
In a one-year training, which includes an internship of 60 hours,

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,560
ex-users of psychiatric services become certified peer
counsellors

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,480
for people in crisis situations. Peer counselling also exists for relatives.

71
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,600
The idea is that we as people who

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,160
have experience with psychiatry or crises

73
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,560
speak to people who are in such a situation right now.

74
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:41,560
I am almost 64 and have had a bipolar condition since I was 27.

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,360
What is very good about the peer counselling is

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,280
that you have experienced people who have experienced similar things.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,880
I often notice the big relief of my counterpart

78
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,840
when I say "there are reasons for why you are how you are"

79
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
and "there is a sense in it".

80
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:14,560
The peer counselling helped me regain my confidence

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,880
and that contributed a lot to my recovery.

82
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,080
To find out

83
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,960
I can be helpful with something that used to affect me terribly

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,040
that is just great.

85
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,640
Impact

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,960
The Trialogue has spread.

87
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,400
It has fed into meetings, conferences and books.

88
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,200
An equal dialogue has been established through the creation

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,840
of psychiatric complaint offices and planning committees, so

90
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,480
people with mental health problems and their relatives have been heard.

91
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,760
To some degree I hope that this also changes

92
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,760
the image of people with psychiatric illness in psychiatry.

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,200
But there is still a lot more to do.
