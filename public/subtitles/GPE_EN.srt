1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,360
GPE Mainz is a social enterprise working for the inclusion

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,520
of people with disabilities and mental health problems.

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,480
GPE offers supported employment opportunities.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,120
The society also runs a centre for diagnosis and rehabilitation,

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,960
and a cafe where young people can receive advice. 

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,720
GPE's facilities and services are placed at the heart of everyday life.

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,800
So, let's say you're visiting Mainz 

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,360
or you work in Mainz

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,600
- whatever - you're in Mainz.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
You're hungry and you want to eat.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,760
There are so many options.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,960
You pop by at the bioshop 'Natürlich Mainz'.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,760
and see that there is a bistrot, too.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,000
And pies.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,320
I came here because the other places in the area were closed

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,440
and then I saw that you can get a good lunch here, too

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,240
I got myself a 'surprise soup' and a ciabatta.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,920
Or you go to 'Gast Hof Grün'  

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,080
to check out the lunch buffet.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,640
I decided to go to 'Gast Hof Grün'

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
mainly because it is so well located for me,

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,840
and because of the wonderful choice of food.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,320
If you want to eat and stay somewhere, 

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,000
you might go to 'Hotel INNdependence'.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,400
In this restaurant, the space here, the cleanliness, are great

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,040
also the service and the friendliness of the people.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,360
You probably know, that young people are trained here,

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,960
that is the social element here.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,120
What you probably won’t see straight away 

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,640
is that all these places are run by 

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,120
the 'Society for Psychosocial facilities' , called GPE Mainz.

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,080
In addition to making good food, 

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,240
they aim to integrate people 

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,200
with disabilities or psychiatric experience.

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200
According to this model, GPE also runs:

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
a clothes shop,

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,120
a tailor,

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
a dry cleaner,

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,440
supermarkets as well as workshops for carpentry, 

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,840
book binding and printing.

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,440
We let our services take place

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,920
where everyday life takes place,

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,000
where the society without disabilities is.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
My name is Ms Langolf 

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,880
and I work in the kitchen of 'Gast Hof Grün'.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,000
I mostly bake cakes and cook meals.

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,560
The cakes will be delivered to 'Cafe Forster'.

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,000
'Hotel INNdependence' also often orders cake.

49
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
GPE services are integrated 

50
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,560
and create employment for each other 

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,040
by buying goods and services from each other.

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,840
My name is Jutta Simon.

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,800
I start at 5:30 in the morning and make breakfast for the guests.

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,960
I ask the guests if they want coffee

55
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,160
I started with an internship

56
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,680
in an old people's home,

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,680
I got this job as a waitress, and was happy about it.

58
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,240
The guest treat us quite well, 

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
they are very friendly

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,560
and say "How nice that you are here again".

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,280
I think this is important both for the employees

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,480
who are in touch with the 'real world'

63
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,040
and for the guests who suddenly realise: 

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,160
"These are employees - oh, they have a disability",

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,680
"That's completely normal" -  he is doing his job

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,240
and that he is sitting in a wheelchair 

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,480
is something you notice but that doesn't play a big role.

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,480
We cover a broad spectrum

69
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,880
from low-threshold employment offers

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,280
to rehabilitation measures

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
to regular socially insured jobs.

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,560
We provide social and psychological support

73
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,480
in all phases of rehabilitation

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,320
even later, when people have found a regular job

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,480
this support is available

76
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
and that is why it works.

77
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,800
I like working here a lot.

78
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,560
Employees are friends,

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,600
and get along well with each other.

80
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,800
We will continue in the future

81
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,280
to place our services at the heart of society.

82
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,560
And with each new business that we found

83
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,000
we believe that we take another step on the way to inclusion.

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,880
If you happen to be in Mainz, 

85
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,120
check out 'Gasthof Gruen', or 'Cafe Forster' - 

86
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,000
even if it's only for the good food.

87
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,200
INNOVATIVE ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT:
