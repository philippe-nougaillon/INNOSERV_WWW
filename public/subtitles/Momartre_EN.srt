1
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,480
The Mom'Pelleport association offers after-school care

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,800
with an artistic focus for 6 to 11 year olds.

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,280
Open until 8pm, the association offers families

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,520
more flexibility than most public childcare services.

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,560
Mom'Pelleport belongs to the Mom'artre network

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,720
comprising 7 associations that all follow the same model. 

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,400
I set up Mom'artre in 2001, in the 18th district of Paris.

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,000
As a single mother, I had to juggle my children, their school and my job.

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,560
There wasn't an appropriate solution for the situation

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,840
so I decided to set up a project for families in the neighbourhood

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,400
and single parents in particular.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
The population of this neighbourhood is quite mixed

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,200
with a lot of social housing, schools and single parent families.

14
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,360
The idea is to offer after-school care,

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,680
from the end of school, tea-break, homework support and artistic activities.

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,960
Who is responsible for washing up at your table?

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,920
Artistic experience is the essential purpose of our project

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,480
for two reasons: the first is about giving all children access to art

19
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,920
the second concerns the employment problems faced by artists.

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,040
We created the role of 'artist-workshop coordinator'

21
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,920
to offer them a position in line with their training.

22
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,120
This one is yours.

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,720
These artists can either work on a one-off project 

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,120
or become MÃ´m'artre employees.

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,000
We organise and finance training in workshop coordination

26
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
leading to an official certificate (BAFA)

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
and offer a range of courses 

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,840
to strengthen their employment prospects.

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,840
I manage the artists who lead workshops during the week.

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,880
And as an artist, I'm in charge of four workshops per week,

31
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:02,640
including photography, painting, ecology, sign language...

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Regular artistic activity 

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,320
- the children come for 3-4 years at least twice a week -

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,720
helps develop skills that are not developed at school

35
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,040
like independence, self-expression, living with others.

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,800
So Arthur, what do you have on your planet?

37
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
Cars...

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,040
In order to make art and culture accessible to everyone,

39
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,920
our fees are adapted to each family's income.

40
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,440
We have ten rates, starting at 10 cents/hour.

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,520
For example, two children from a family come twice a week

42
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,320
and their monthly bill is around 4,50 Euros.

43
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,920
Our objective is to offer a service to a wide public

44
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,960
so every two months we organise an art exhibition 

45
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,680
to showcase the children's and artists' work.

46
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,880
So all families and residents in the neighbourhood are invited

47
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,160
to get together around art.

48
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:27,440
I appreciate that the service is adapted to everyone.

49
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,840
It's child focused but

50
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,640
it also involves the neighbourhood through the association network.

51
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,640
It's really about 'popular' education in all its glory.

52
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,600
It's an innovative, interesting and original artistic approach 

53
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,600
and it's in my neighbourhood.

54
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,480
Mom'artre provides solutions for a range of groups, by:

55
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,280
Offering after-school care with an artistic orientation for children;

56
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,760
Allowing parents, and in particular single parents,

57
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,240
to reconcile work and family life;

58
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,800
Providing employment opportunities and training for artists;

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,280
Fostering social cohesion by opening Mom'artre

60
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,960
 to the neighbourhood, its residents and associations.

61
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,080
At present, Mom'artre  comprises 7 associations in Paris, Nantes and Arles.

62
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,120
The network plans to extend its services to more municipalities

63
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,400
creating 3 new associations per year.
